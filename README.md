# How to use

- First of all, I suggest backing up the whole game installation directory, which will serve as your vanilla game if you ever need it.

- You must have BepInEx framework available in your game installation folder. It is a modding framework which is widely used for modding games made using the Unity engine.
[Here](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/) are the steps on how to use it, follow the manual installation guide.

- When you are done installing BepInEx, go to the [releases](https://github.com/JuliusAndreas/REPO-game-my-special-edition/releases) section of this repository, choose and download a version which is a zip/RAR archive.
- Drop all of the contents in the downloaded archive into your [game_installation_path (where the game executable exists)]/BepInEx/plugins folder.
- Start the game — BepInEx will auto-detect and load the plugins. If a console opens upon launching the game, then it's working fine.
- Optional: edit the plugin config under BepInEx/config if the plugin has any config.
- You can check BepInEx/LogOutput.log for load-time messages and troubleshooting.
